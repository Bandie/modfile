modfile
=======
A haskell implementation for reading and writing various module file formats, used by music trackers. Still heavy work in progress.

At the moment, the impulse tracker (.it) and the extended module (.xm) formats are supported, .mod-support is in work. Documentation for them can be found here:
* XM: ftp://ftp.modland.com/pub/documents/format_documentation/FastTracker%202%20v2.04%20%28.xm%29.html
* IT: https://github.com/schismtracker/schismtracker/wiki/ITTECH.TXT
* MOD: http://www.fileformat.info/format/mod/corion.htm and http://www.aes.id.au/modformat.html
